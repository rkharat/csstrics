<p>I&#8217;m of mixing feelings. I do like the idea of the web being a competitive platform for building any sort of app and sometimes fancy APIs like this open those doors. </p>



<p>Not to mention that some of these APIs are designed to do responsible things, like knowing connections speeds through the Network Information API and sending less data if you can, and the same for the Battery Status API. </p>



<p>This is all a similar situation to <code>:visited</code> in CSS. Have you ever noticed how there are some CSS declarations you can&#8217;t use on visited links?

<p>Managing a custom collection of icons in a Vue app can be challenging at times. An icon font is easy to use, but for customization, you have to rely on third-party font generators, and merge conflicts can be painful to resolve since fonts are binary files.</p>



<p>Using SVG files instead can eliminate those pain points, but how can we ensure they’re just as easy to use while also making it easy to add or remove icons?</p>



<span id="more-317398"></span>



<p>Here is what my ideal icon system looks like:</p>



<ul><li>To add icons, you just drop them into a designated <code>icons</code> folder. If you no longer need an icon, you simply delete it.</li><li>To use the rocket.svg icon in a template, the syntax is as simple as <code>&lt;svg-icon icon="rocket" /&gt;</code>.</li><li>The icons can be scaled and colored using the CSS <code>font-size</code> and <code>color</code> properties (just like an icon font).</li><li>If multiple instances of the same icon appear on the page, the SVG code is not duplicated each time.</li><li>No webpack config editing is required.</li></ul>



<p>This is what we will build by writing two small, single-file components. There are a few specific requirements for this implementation, though I&#8217;m sure many of you wizards out there could rework this system for other frameworks and build tools:</p>



<ul><li>webpack: If you used the Vue CLI to scaffold your app, then you’re already using webpack.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/webpack-contrib/svg-inline-loader">svg-inline-loader</a>: This allows us to load all of our SVG code and clean up portions we do not want. Go ahead and run <code>npm install svg-inline-loader --save-dev</code> from the terminal to get started.</li></ul>



<h3>The SVG sprite component</h3>



<p>To meet our requirement of not repeating SVG code for each instance of an icon on the page, we need to build an SVG &#8220;sprite.&#8221; If you haven&#8217;t heard of an <a href="https://css-tricks.com/svg-sprites-use-better-icon-fonts/">SVG sprite</a> before, think of it as a hidden SVG that houses other SVGs. Anywhere we need to display an icon, we can copy it out of the sprite by referencing the id of the icon inside a <code>&lt;use&gt;</code> tag like this:</p>



<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;svg>&lt;use xlink:href="#rocket" />&lt;/svg></code></pre>



<p>That little bit of code is essentially how our <code>&lt;SvgIcon&gt;</code> component will work, but let&#8217;s go ahead create the <code>&lt;SvgSprite&gt;</code> component first. Here is the entire <code>SvgSprite.vue</code> file; some of it may seem daunting at first, but I will break it all down.</p>



<pre rel="JavaScript" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;!-- SvgSprite.vue -->

&lt;template>
  &lt;svg width="0" height="0" style="display: none;" v-html="$options.svgSprite" />
&lt;/template>

&lt;script>
const svgContext = require.context(
  '!svg-inline-loader?' + 
  'removeTags=true' + // remove title tags, etc.
  '&amp;removeSVGTagAttrs=true' + // enable removing attributes
  '&amp;removingTagAttrs=fill' + // remove fill attributes
  '!@/assets/icons', // search this directory
  true, // search subdirectories
  /\w+\.svg$/i // only include SVG files
)
const symbols = svgContext.keys().map(path => {
  // get SVG file content
  const content = svgContext(path)
   // extract icon id from filename
  const id = path.replace(/^\.\/(.*)\.\w+$/, '$1')
  // replace svg tags with symbol tags and id attribute
  return content.replace('&lt;svg', `&lt;symbol id="${id}"`).replace('svg>', 'symbol>')
})
export default {
  name: 'SvgSprite',
  svgSprite: symbols.join('\n'), // concatenate all symbols into $options.svgSprite
}
&lt;/script></code></pre>



<p>In the template, our lone <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> element has its content bound to <code>$options.svgSprite</code>. In case you&#8217;re unfamiliar with <code>$options</code> it contains properties that are directly attached to our Vue component. We could have attached <code>svgSprite</code> to our component&#8217;s <code>data</code>, but we don&#8217;t really need Vue to set up reactivity for this since our SVG loader is only going to run when our app builds.</p>



<p>In our script, we use <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/dependency-management/%23requirecontext"><code>require.context</code></a> to retrieve all of our SVG files and clean them up while we’re at it. We invoke <code>svg-inline-loader</code> and pass it several parameters using syntax that is very similar to query string parameters. I&#8217;ve broken these up into multiple lines to make them easier to understand.</p>



<pre rel="JavaScript" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript" data-line=""><code markup="tt">const svgContext = require.context(
  '!svg-inline-loader?' + 
  'removeTags=true' + // remove title tags, etc.
  '&amp;removeSVGTagAttrs=true' + // enable removing attributes
  '&amp;removingTagAttrs=fill' + // remove fill attributes
  '!@/assets/icons', // search this directory
  true, // search subdirectories
  /\w+\.svg$/i // only include SVG files
)</code></pre>



<p>What we’re basically doing here is cleaning up the SVG files that live in a specific directory <code>(/assets/icons</code>) so that they’re in good shape to use anywhere we need them.</p>



<p>The <code>removeTags</code> parameter strips out tags that we do not need for our icons, such as <code>title</code> and <code>style</code>. We especially want to remove <code>title</code> tags since those can cause unwanted tooltips. If you would like to preserve any hard-coded styling in your icons, then add <code>removingTags=title</code> as an additional parameter so that only <code>title</code> tags are removed.</p>



<p>We also tell our loader to remove <code>fill</code> attributes, so that we can set our own <code>fill</code> colors with CSS later. It’s possible you will want to retain your <code>fill</code> colors. If that’s the case, then simply remove the <code>removeSVGTagAttrs</code> and <code>removingTagAttrs</code> parameters.</p>



<p>The last loader parameter is the path to our SVG icon folder. We then provide <code>require.context</code> with two more parameters so that it searches subdirectories and only loads SVG files.</p>



<p>In order to nest all of our SVG elements inside our SVG sprite, we have to convert them from <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> elements into SVG <code>&lt;symbol&gt;</code> elements. This is as simple as changing the tag and giving each one a unique <code>id</code>, which we extract from the filename.</p>



<pre rel="JavaScript" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript" data-line=""><code markup="tt">const symbols = svgContext.keys().map(path => {
  // extract icon id from filename
  const id = path.replace(/^\.\/(.*)\.\w+$/, '$1')
  // get SVG file content
  const content = svgContext(path)
  // replace svg tags with symbol tags and id attribute
  return content.replace('&lt;svg', `&lt;symbol id="${id}"`).replace('svg>', 'symbol>')
})</code></pre>



<p>What do we do with this <code>&lt;SvgSprite&gt;</code> component? We place it on our page before any icons that depend on it. I recommend adding it to the top of the <code>App.vue</code> file.</p>



<pre rel="JavaScript" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;!-- App.vue -->
&lt;template>
  &lt;div id="app">
    &lt;svg-sprite />
&lt;!-- ... --></code></pre>



<h3>The icon component</h3>



<p>Now let’s build the <code>SvgIcon.vue</code> component.</p>



<pre rel="JavaScript" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;!-- SvgIcon.vue -->

&lt;template>
  &lt;svg class="icon" :class="{ 'icon-spin': spin }">
    &lt;use :xlink:href="`#${icon}`" />
  &lt;/svg>
&lt;/template>

&lt;script>
export default {
  name: 'SvgIcon',
  props: {
    icon: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
    spin: {
      type: Boolean,
      default: false,
    },
  },
}
&lt;/script>

&lt;style>
svg.icon {
  fill: currentColor;
  height: 1em;
  margin-bottom: 0.125em;
  vertical-align: middle;
  width: 1em;
}
svg.icon-spin {
  animation: icon-spin 2s infinite linear;
}
@keyframes icon-spin {
  from {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
  to {
    transform: rotate(359deg);
  }
}
&lt;/style></code></pre>



<p>This component is much simpler. As previously mentioned, we leverage the <code>&lt;use&gt;</code> tag to reference an id inside our sprite. That <code>id</code> comes from our component’s <code>icon</code> prop.</p>



<p>I’ve added a <code>spin</code> prop in there that toggles an <code>.icon-spin</code> class as an optional bit of animation, should we ever need. This could, for example, be useful for a loading spinner icon.</p>



<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;svg-icon v-if="isLoading" icon="spinner" spin /></code></pre>



<p>Depending on your needs, you may want to add additional props, such as <code>rotate</code> or <code>flip</code>. You could simply add the classes directly to the component without using props if you’d like.</p>



<p>Most of our component’s content is CSS. Other than the spinning animation, most of this is used to make our SVG icon act more like an icon font<a href="#fn1">¹</a>. To align the icons to the text baseline, I’ve found that applying <code>vertical-align: middle</code>, along with a bottom margin of <code>0.125em</code>, works for most cases. We also set the <code>fill</code> attribute value to <code>currentColor</code>, which allows us to color the icon just like text.</p>



<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;p style="font-size: 2em; color: red;">
  &lt;svg-icon icon="exclamation-circle" />&lt;!-- This icon will be 2em and red. -->
  Error!
&lt;/p></code></pre>



<p>That’s it! &nbsp;If you want to use the icon component anywhere in your app without having to import it into every component that needs it, be sure to register the component in your <code>main.js</code> file:</p>



<pre rel="JavaScript" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript" data-line=""><code markup="tt">// main.js
import Vue from 'vue'
import SvgIcon from '@/components/SvgIcon.vue'
Vue.component('svg-icon', SvgIcon)
// ...</code></pre>

<h3><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h3>



<p>Here are a few ideas for improvements, which I intentionally left out to keep this solution approachable:</p>



<ul><li>Scale icons that have non-square dimensions to maintain their proportions</li><li>Inject the SVG sprite into the page without needing an additional component.</li><li>Make it work with <a href="https://github.com/vitejs/vite">vite</a>, which is a new, fast (and webpack-free) build tool from Vue creator Evan You.</li><li>Leverage the Vue 3 <a href="https://composition-api.vuejs.org/api.html">Composition API</a>.</li></ul>



<p>If you want to quickly take these components for a spin, <a href="https://github.com/kevinleedrum/vue-svg-icon-demo">I’ve created a demo app</a> based on the default vue-cli template. I hope this helps you develop an implementation that fits your app’s needs!</p>

<p>Heydon&#8217;s <a href="https://heydonworks.com/article/the-flexbox-holy-albatross/">Holy Albatross</a> is a technique to have a <em>row</em> of elements break into a <em>column</em> of elements at a specific width. A <em>specified <strong>parent</strong></em> width, not a <em><strong>screen</strong> width</em> like a media query would have. So, like a container query (ya know, those things that don&#8217;t exist yet that we all want).</p>



<p><a href="https://css-tricks.com/putting-the-flexbox-albatross-to-real-use/">I&#8217;ve used it before</a>, although it was pointed out to me that using it only on two elements isn&#8217;t really necessary, and that the Holy Albatross is most useful when working with three or more elements.</p>



<span id="more-317139"></span>



<p>The original article kind didn&#8217;t get into setting the widths on the horizontal row of elements (say one of them needs to be larger than the others), but <a href="https://heydonworks.com/article/the-flexbox-holy-albatross-reincarnated/">the follow-up article</a> has <a href="https://codepen.io/heydon/pen/pqGgbR">a demo</a> in it showing that <code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/flex-grow/">flex-grow</a></code> can be used to do exactly that. But Xiao Zhuo Jia notes that it&#8217;s not exactly a great system:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Problem is, it&#8217;s very difficult to set width to your non-stacked column, because the width is taken over by the hack.</p><p>One suggestion by Heydon is to use&nbsp;<a href="https://codepen.io/heydon/pen/pqGgbR">flex-grow</a>, the problems are:</p><p>1. It is a very unintuitive way to set width &#8211; for a 3 column layout, you want 1 column to be 50% wide, you have to set flex-grow to 2.333<br>2. You have to know the number of total columns and set other columns&#8217; flex-grow value accordingly</p><p>The other method is to use min-width and max-width, as shown by this&nbsp;<a href="https://codepen.io/heydon/pen/ebQyYV">codepen</a>. I don&#8217;t believe&nbsp;<code>max-width: 100%</code>&nbsp;is needed as anything larger than 100% will be changed to 100% due to flex-shrink, so really we&#8217;re dealing with min-width.</p><p>The problem with this method is that we have to set min-width for all columns, or else flex-grow will take over and expand the column beyond the min-width we&#8217;ve set.</p><p>None of this is fun.</p><p>I poked around a bit and I found that you can have your cake and eat it too&#8230;</p></blockquote>



<p>Xiao Zhuo Jia&nbsp;calls <a href="http://www.miragecraft.com/articles/unholy_albatross.html">the Unholy Albatross</a>. Check out the <strong>How does it work?</strong> part of the article to see the great CSS trickery. It has to do with using the <code>max()</code> function and CSS custom properties with fullbacks. It still feels very in the spirit of the Holy Albatross and allows you to set the width (via <code>--width</code>) on any given element with a pixel value <em>or</em> ratio. Plus, it supports gaps. </p>

<p>My session?</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>CSS-Tricks: Putting WordPress to Work<br></strong><br>Chris Coyier’s CSS-Tricks is a popular publication geared to web designers and developers. It’s also very much a business powered by WordPress. Chris will take us behind the scenes at CSS-Tricks, sharing all the ways it takes advantage of WordPress features, on both the technical and business sides.</p></blockquote>



<p>Selena sent me some interesting questions as well:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>What has kept you on WordPress&nbsp;for all these years? How has your website been essential to your growth or success?</p></blockquote>



<p>It&#8217;s true that CSS-Tricks has never been anything but a WordPress site. I&#8217;ve never switched platforms or majorly re-architected in any way. But it&#8217;s not because of laziness or because I just don&#8217;t have any exposure to other methods of website building. I feel fortunate in that I&#8217;ve had lots of exposure and experience to different ways to build websites, from JAMstack  with static site generators with cloud functions, to CMSs of all sorts, to Ruby on Rails sites, to Python-based sites&#8230; all kinds of stuff. All of it has a place.</p>



<p>Part of the equation is that I&#8217;m a solo developer for the most part on CSS-Tricks. Just me over here. I don&#8217;t have the budget for a fancy development team. But I still want to feel powerful and productive. That&#8217;s one of the things that WordPress has given to me. I feel like I can build just about anything on WordPress, and do it in a way that doesn&#8217;t feel like a mountain of technical debt that I would struggle to maintain.</p>



<p>Even though there is a decent amount of custom stuff going on, it probably looks like more than it is. Most of the work I do is pretty normcore WordPress development. I use popular well-maintained plugins. I use standard filters. I use the templating system as it was designed. I try to do things &#8220;The WordPress Way&#8221;, and that means year after year it&#8217;s very easy for me to maintain the site and build out what I want to build out. I never worry if I&#8217;m going against the grain or that I&#8217;m doing anything that puts me at any risk of not being able to upgrade things.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>What&#8217;s one key thing you want our Growth Summit attendees to take away from your keynote talk/session?</p></blockquote>



<p>I think my main vibe is going to be sharing just how powerful WordPress can be as a platform to run a publishing business on. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In a crowded and noisy web environment, what did you do to help your website stand out? What&#8217;s unique about your story or business?</p></blockquote>



<p>What I hope we stand out for is the content on the site itself. We strive to be consistent, trustworthy, friendly, and helpful. In a world so laden with misinformation, zero-ethics advertising, and UX-hostile interfaces trying to squeeze everything they can from you, a site that&#8217;s just trying to help you understand the web and run a normal business out of it I hope feels as good to other people as it does to me.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Has COVID-19 changed how you use your website — or your approach to your online presence?</p></blockquote>



<p>Not terribly. I&#8217;m finding advertisers pulling back a little bit, and keeping a closer eye on their sponsorship investments. And while I don&#8217;t love the idea of seeing those dollars go down, I don&#8217;t blame them. It&#8217;s smart for any business to make sure their money is well-spent.</p>

<p>Vue is in the process of a complete overhaul that rebuilds the popular JavaScript framework from the ground up. This has been going on the last couple of years and, at long last, the API and implementation of Vue 3 core are now stabilize. This is exciting for a number of reasons:</p>



<ul><li>Vue 3 promises to be much more performant than Vue 2.</li><li>Despite being a complete rewrite, the surface API hasn&#8217;t changed drastically, so there&#8217;s no need to forget what you already know about Vue.</li><li>The Vue documentation was completely migrated revised. (If you see me celebrating that, it&#8217;s because I helped work on it.)</li><li>There are several new features — like the Composition API (inspired by React Hooks) — that are additive and helpful for composition between multiple components.</li></ul>



<span id="more-317490"></span>



<p>Here&#8217;s how you can get your hands on the Vue 3 release candidate:</p>



<ul><li>Play with it on&nbsp;<a href="https://codepen.io/team/Vue/pen/KKpRVpx">CodePen</a>, or include it with a script using <code>https://unpkg.com/vue@next</code>.</li><li>Start a project using&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/vitejs/vite">Vite</a>&nbsp;with<code>npm init vite-app hello-vue3</code>. Vite comes with&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/blob/sfc-improvements/active-rfcs/0000-sfc-script-setup.md"><code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/blob/sfc-improvements/active-rfcs/0000-sfc-style-variables.md"><code>&lt;style vars&gt;</code></a>&nbsp;support in single file components.</li><li>There is a <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/pull/5637">Vue CLI pull request</a> you can track.</li></ul>



<p>There is more information about DevTools, experimental features and more in <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/issues/189">the release notes</a>.</p>



<h4>Docs updates, now in beta</h4>



<p>Why am I so excited about the Vue doc updates? Because the updates include but are not limited to:</p>



<ul><li>A <a href="https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/migration/introduction.html#overview">migration guide</a> to help you navigate between versions</li><li>A brand new <a href="https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/a11y-basics.html">accessibility section</a></li><li>A deep dive on the <a href="https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-introduction.html">Composition API</a></li><li>An overhaul of the <a href="https://v3.vuejs.org/api/application-config.html">API docs</a></li><li>A revision of the <a href="https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/reactivity.html">Reactivity section</a>, including animated explainers.</li><li>A <a href="https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/writing-guide.html">new guide</a> on contributing to Vue</li><li>A major revision of the Transitions section, including a <a href="https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/transitions-overview.html">new Overview section</a>.</li></ul>



<p>We are still actively working on things, of course, so if you see to-dos or unresolved work, please let us know! Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/docs-next">open an issue or PR over at GitHub</a> but, please, note that large requests will likely be closed out while we&#8217;re still refining our current work.</p>



<p>All in all we think you&#8217;ll enjoy it! It&#8217;s all the features you know and love, with some extra lovely bits, plus excellent performance.</p>

<p>Anyone who&#8217;s ever performed an &#8220;Interactive Rebase&#8221; is amazed by how easy that is in Tower: you simply drag and drop to combine commits or reorder them. And anyone who hasn&#8217;t yet used &#8220;Interactive Rebase&#8221; &#8211; because it was too complicated and clunky to use on the command line &#8211; now understands that it&#8217;s a very valuable tool.</p>



<p>Or I might make a mistake: accidentally deleting a branch or messing up a merge in a terrible way. And I&#8217;ll simply hit CMD+Z, like I would in a text editor, to undo the mess I just made.</p>



<p>People then start to realize that the real question is not: &#8220;Can I&nbsp;<em>get by</em>&nbsp;using Git on the command line?&#8221; The more important questions are:</p>



<ul><li>Can I use&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;of Git&#8217;s power? (Even the advanced features that might be hard to use, but that can be very valuable&#8230;)</li><li>Can I work with Git in a&nbsp;<em>productive&nbsp;</em>way? (Not having to look up parameters, not spending too much time on my workflows&#8230;)</li><li>Can I work with Git in an&nbsp;<em>easy</em>&nbsp;way? (Without having to think about it too much&#8230;)</li></ul>



<p>We &#8211; a small team of just 9 people &#8211; have spent the last 10 years answering those questions by building Tower.</p>



<h2>How to Undo Mistakes</h2>



<p>One of Git&#8217;s greatest features is that it allows you to undo almost anything. However, it requires quite some experience to know how&nbsp;<em>exactly</em>&nbsp;to undo your&nbsp;<em>particular</em>&nbsp;kind of mess: a failed merge has to be cleaned up differently than a deleted branch!</p>



<p>After working on this for a long time, Tower now allows you to undo virtually anything &#8211; simply by pressing CMD+Z!&nbsp;<em>(Note: the &#8220;Undo&#8221; feature is a quite recent addition and first available in the Mac version of Tower. It will soon come to Windows, too).</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video autoplay controls loop src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/undo-mistakes.mp4" playsinline></video></figure>



<p>No matter if you messed up a merge, inadvertently deleted a branch, discarded a valuable local change, published a branch on a remote too soon, or simply committed something that you shouldn&#8217;t have &#8211; your lifesaver is as simple as &#8220;CMD+Z&#8221;, and it&#8217;s always available.</p>



<h2>The Power of Interactive Rebase</h2>



<p>Interactive Rebase is a wonderful example of Git&#8217;s more powerful features. It allows you to&#8230;</p>



<ul><li>edit old commits (both their messages as well as their changesets!)</li><li>combine multiple commits into one</li><li>reorder commits</li><li>&#8230;and even delete commits you don&#8217;t need anymore!</li></ul>



<p>All of these can help a lot to keep a code base clean and structured. But being a very powerful tool, Interactive Rebase is also an example of a Git feature that is quite&nbsp;<em>complicated to use</em>!</p>



<p>Many&nbsp;<em>beginners</em>&nbsp;are scared away by this complexity &#8211; meaning that, of course, they will miss out on the benefits of the feature! Many&nbsp;<em>experienced</em>&nbsp;developers know and use Interactive Rebase; but since the feature is hard to use, it costs them a lot of time and/or they make mistakes from time to time.</p>



<p>Knowing this, we had two goals for integrating Interactive Rebase into Tower: on the one hand, we wanted to reduce as much of its complexity as possible. And on the other hand, we wanted to make the feature easily accessible.</p>



<p>The result is that Interactive Rebase is now integrated right into the &#8220;Commit History&#8221; and accessible via simple drag &amp; drop and menu options:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video autoplay controls loop src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/interactive-rebase.mp4" playsinline></video></figure>



<p>Countless developers that wouldn&#8217;t have used Interactive Rebase&nbsp;<em>at all</em>&nbsp;on the Command Line are now using it on a daily basis in Tower.</p>



<h2>Quick Actions</h2>



<p>Almost independent of its size, working in a code base means spending a lot of time&nbsp;<em>searching</em>: for example for a certain branch (out of lots of branches) or a certain file (out of lots of files).</p>



<p>Tower allows you to do most of your daily tasks without sifting through data &#8211; and even without taking your hands off the keyboard. The &#8220;Quick Action&#8221; dialog takes almost any input and allows you to simply&nbsp;<em>act</em>&nbsp;on it:</p>



<ul><li>Give it a branch name and it will offer to do a checkout.</li><li>Give it a file name and it will offer to show it in the File History.</li><li>Give it a commit hash and it will offer to show that commit&#8217;s details.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video autoplay controls loop src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/quick-actions.mp4" playsinline></video></figure>



<p>Being able to perform many tasks right from the keyboard, without having to search and sift through loads of data, can make life as a developer a lot easier.</p>



<h2>Solving Conflicts with Confidence</h2>



<p>Everyone hates that moment when a merge (or rebase) stops and leaves you with a bunch of conflicts &#x1f631; Multiple questions then quickly enter the poor programmer&#8217;s mind:</p>



<ul><li>What are&nbsp;<em>my</em>&nbsp;changes? What are someone else&#8217;s?</li><li>What&nbsp;<em>actually</em>&nbsp;happened?</li><li>Why me?</li></ul>



<p>While, admittedly, Tower cannot answer&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;of those questions, it offers a special &#8220;Conflict Wizard&#8221; that helps make the situation much more understandable:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video autoplay controls loop src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/conflict-wizard_fullwindow_mac.mp4" playsinline></video></figure>



<p>You can easily see where changes came from and can solve the conflict simply by&nbsp;<em>choosing</em>&nbsp;which version to go with (or jump into a dedicated merge tool). It makes things a lot easier when merge conflicts are visualized in this way, instead of being an abstract mess.</p>



<h2>Becoming More Productive</h2>



<p>When building and improving Tower, we&#8217;re always striving to make things&nbsp;<em>easier</em>&nbsp;for our users &#8211; and to make them&nbsp;<em>more productive</em>. Let’s take some examples of where this shows in Tower:</p>



<ul><li><strong>No More Passwords, Tokens, SSH Keys:</strong>&nbsp;You can easily connect your GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket / Azure DevOps accounts with Tower. Once connected, you never have to wrestle with passwords, authentication, tokens, usernames, and SSH Keys anymore. Cloning and interacting with a remote repository, then, is a matter of just a click.</li><li><strong>Single-Line Staging &amp; Discarding:</strong>&nbsp;There&#8217;s a golden rule in version control: when you make a commit, you should only include changes from a&nbsp;<em>single</em>&nbsp;topic (and not mix multiple topics in a commit, thereby making it extremely hard to understand what actually happened). With the ability to stage / unstage / discard&nbsp;<em>individual chunks and lines</em>&nbsp;from your changes, Tower enables you to create granular, precise commits.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video autoplay controls loop src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/single-line-staging.mp4" playsinline></video></figure>



<ul><li><strong>A New Diff Viewer:</strong>&nbsp;In a very recent update, we gave our internal Diff Viewer a complete overhaul. It now highlights inline changes, allows you to show/hide whitespace changes, can display the complete file, and is completely customizable with themes!</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video autoplay controls loop src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/diff-viewer.mp4" playsinline></video></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Automations for the Boring Stuff:</strong>&nbsp;Tower takes care of much of the grunt work around Git. To take just two examples: neither do you have to regularly fetch new updates from the remote, nor do you have to remember to stage uncommitted changes before pulling/switching branches/merging&#8230; Tower does that automatically for you.</li></ul>



<p>When I think about the favorite applications I use myself, they all have some things in common: they make life easier for me, they make me more productive, and they enable me to do advanced stuff that I&#8217;d have a hard time doing without them. I&#8217;m glad and grateful that many of our users consider Tower to be one of their favorite apps!</p>

<p class="explanation">Fair warning: I can&#8217;t say I recommend this in general because it breaks a very strong expectation of where scrollbars are, which are useful for a lots of folks, not to mention, a core accessibility feature for many.</p>



<p>But it is a fascinating CSS trick and the web is a big place with an unknowable magnitude of situations where sometimes weird solutions are needed.</p>



<span id="more-317266"></span>



<h3>Technique #1: Directional Trickery</h3>



<p>The trick here is to have the scrolling parent element use <code>direction: rtl</code> (or the opposite of whatever your primary direction is), and have the inside of the scrolling element switch back to whatever your normal is.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_ExPdXxz" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/ExPdXxz?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=ExPdXxz&amp;default-tab=css,result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed ExPdXxz" title="CodePen Embed ExPdXxz" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<h3>Technique #2: Rotational Trickery</h3>



<p>Messing with text direction for non text-direction purposes always feels a little scary to me, so this trick feels less hacky. The trick is to rotate the parent <code>180deg</code>, and then the child back another <code>180deg</code> so it&#8217;s upright again. </p>



<p>Because of the first rotation, the scrollbar ends up on the opposite side.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_vYLVZNK" src="//codepen.io/anon/embed/vYLVZNK?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=vYLVZNK&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name="CodePen Embed vYLVZNK" title="CodePen Embed vYLVZNK" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>



<p>This one is especially awkward for two reasons:</p>



<ol><li>The scrolling element is scrolled to the bottom by default</li><li>The scroll direction feels reversed with a scroll wheel. The scrollbar itself should behave somewhat as expected, but a trackpad or mouse scrollwheel will feel like the scroll direction has been reversed in that element.</li></ol>



<p>More like an April Fool&#8217;s joke than something you&#8217;d really use. <a href="https://twitter.com/chordbug/status/1101645780962734081?s=12">A viral tweet called it cursed</a>, which, yes.</p>

<p>I forked it, swapped out all the images so it shows the JPG first, and put <code>loading="lazy"</code> on the images. It seems to effectively <em>not</em> load the GIF until you explicitly press play, so that&#8217;s an option too:</p>
